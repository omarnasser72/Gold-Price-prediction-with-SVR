# Gold-Price-prediction-with-SVR
it's supervised machine learning project it was assigned for me during my internship at CodeClause I used Support Vector Machine(SVR) to solve this regression problem 
In this project I used:
1)rbf kernal and C with iterative value to maxmize accuracy percentage
2)mean squared error and mean absolute error metricsto calculate efficieny of th model
3)Residual Plot graph
4)actual vs Predicted Plot graph
5)Distribution Plot graph
6)Finally Correlation Matrics
I came up with accuracy 98.83%
